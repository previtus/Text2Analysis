"Programmes, such as Sir David Attenborough's Planet Earth II series, boost people's awareness and interest in species, a study has suggested.

Despite lacking an overt conservation message, the programmes stimulated people to find out more about the species featured in the broadcasts.

The team from University College Cork based their findings on analysing data from Twitter and Wikipedia.

The findings have been published in Conservation Letters journal.

The researchers said their results appeared to show that ""natural history films can provide vicarious connection to nature and can generate durable shifts in audience awareness"".

Conservation criticism
Co-author Dario Fernandez-Bellon said that he and co-author Dr Adam Kane decided to carry out the study after the Planet Earth II series attracted some criticism for not carrying a more overt conservation message.

The scientists decided to investigate the initial criticism more closely, using ""big data"" collated from Twitter and Wikipedia, to see if there was an issue that needed to be highlighted.

""We found that there was, in fact, very little of the script dedicated to conservation,"" observed Dr Fernandez-Bellon, ""and that barely had any impact on Twitter, let alone Wikipedia.""

But the researchers found that there was a clear link when it came to the species featured in the programmes.

""What we found was that people's reactions and interest in species was mainly led by how long they were on screen, and independent of whether they were mammals, birds or reptiles,"" he told BBC News.

In other words, the creatures did not have to be so-called ""charismatic species"" in order to attract attention.

Dr Fernandez-Bellon added: ""It was really quite interesting because it showcases that dilemma producers sometimes have in finding the balance between producing a show that's entertaining, while generating awareness in people without taking a preachy approach.""

He observed: ""If a producer wants to highlight a specific species that is endangered, they do not really have to rattle on about how endangered it is, but just by giving it more time on screen, people are more likely to go on to Wikipedia and find out the information themselves.""

Media professionals recognise that an increasing proportion of the audience now ""dual-screen"", which describes how they watch television while also using a mobile device, such as a smartphone or a tablet.

Drs Fernandez-Bellon and Kane also decided to see if the data suggested the programmes led to people taking a more proactive approach when it came to conservation, such as donating to a wildlife charity.

""We did look at a couple of charities to see whether they registered peaks in donations around the time Planet Earth II was broadcast,"" Dr Fernandez-Bellon said.

""The truth is that there was not, not in the same way we had found a peak in Twitter activity, and a peak in Wikipedia activity but there was not in proactive action.""

Dr Fernandez-Bellon said that there was a lot of scope to use the big data from social media platforms, such as Twitter, to help shape policies on how to communicate conservation to a wider audience.

""If this data is being used for marketing or business purposes, why couldn't we use it for conservation purposes or to assess potential changes in human behaviour,"" he said.

"The fall-out from the coronavirus crisis is even being felt in space.

Rising infection rates near key technical centres in Louisiana and Mississippi mean the US space agency is suspending production and testing of its Moon rocket and capsule systems.

The Trump administration had set 2024 for the first crewed mission to the lunar surface in 50 years – an already challenging target.

That date looks even more optimistic now.

Nasa said it had no choice but to suspend work on the construction of the rocket, called the Space Launch System, and the capsule, known as Orion.

The Stennis Space Center in Mississippi has had one confirmed infection among its staff, and although the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana hasn't yet had a COVID-19 case - growing infection rates in the communities around both complexes means a shut-down is the only sensible option.

Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine said staff were now moving to put hardware in a safe condition.

“We realise there will be impacts to Nasa missions, but as our teams work to analyse the full picture and reduce risks we understand that our top priority is the health and safety of the Nasa workforce,” he added.

Nasa Moon rocket core leaves for testing

Nasa's next Mars rover will be called Perseverance

ExoMars Rosalind Franklin: Rover mission delayed until 2022

Engineers had been transferring the first core stage of the SLS from Michoud to Stennis for a test firing, after which the plan then was to take it to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for an uncrewed test flight.

The launch was being pencilled in for early next year. This mission, dubbed Artemis 1, would be followed by a crewed trip around the Moon, before the first planned landing, Artemis 3, in 2024.

Nasa has instigated teleworking across its organisation, but engineering work continues on a number of high-priority missions.

Key among these is the new Mars rover, Perseverance.

It's currently at Kennedy being prepared for a launch to the Red Planet in July/August.

This is a hard deadline for the robot. Because Earth-Mars journeys are only attempted when the planets are favourably aligned, the rover project will get bumped to 2022 if it misses the summer flight window.

Europe has already been forced into this position. Its Rosalind Franklin rover mission has been put back by 26 months.

The European Space Agency robot, a joint venture with Russia, was already struggling to meet its launch date because of a troublesome development schedule. But these difficulties were then further complicated by the inability of engineering teams to move around freely.

"Vampire bats establish friendships by sharing regurgitated blood with their neighbours in a ""kind of horrifying French kiss"", a new study says.

Researchers observing the mammals said their sharing behaviours appeared to be an important aspect of their bonding.

If bats go three days without eating, they can die of starvation, so sharing the blood can be a life-saving act.

The study, published in the journal Current Biology, aimed to determine how the species developed relationships.

It found that when the vampire bats became isolated in a roost, pairs unfamiliar with one another - but in close proximity - would begin grooming, then ""mouth-licking"" before swapping food.

Secrets of how vampire bats became bloodthirsty
Five things you might not know about bats
""We go from bats starting as strangers from different colonies to groupmates that act to save each other's life,"" said Prof Gerald Carter, author of the study and behavioural ecologist at Ohio State University.

""They have this 'boom and bust' foraging experience, so they either hit it big and get a large blood meal or they're starved for that night.

""Food sharing in vampire bats is like how a lot of birds regurgitate food for their offspring. But what's special with vampire bats is they do this for other adults,"" Prof Carter said.

He added that the bats would groom even after their fur had been cleansed, suggesting that the behaviour was not just an issue of maintaining hygiene.

Vampire bats are the only mammals to feed entirely on blood, which they get by biting larger animals such as cattle.

The flying creatures can drink up to half their weight in blood a day, unlike their other bat relatives, which generally dine on fruit, nectar or insects.

In November, a scientific study discovered that bats that form bonds while in captivity often continue their relationships when released back into the wild.

"A newly discovered fossil bird could be the earliest known ancestor of every chicken on the planet.

Living just before the asteroid strike that wiped out giant dinosaurs, the unique fossil, from about 67 million years ago, gives a glimpse into the dawn of modern birds.

Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but precisely when they evolved into birds like the ones alive today has been difficult to answer.

This is due to a lack of fossil data.

The newly discovered - and well-preserved - fossil skull should help fill in some of the gaps.

""This is a unique specimen: we've been calling it the 'wonderchicken',"" said Dr Daniel Field of the University of Cambridge.

""It's the only nearly complete skull of a modern bird that we have, so far, from the age of dinosaurs and it's able to tell us quite a lot about the early evolutionary history of birds.""

The fossil bird has been named Asteriornis maastrichtensis, after Asteria, a Greek goddess of falling stars who turns into a quail. It was found in a quarry on the Netherlands-Belgium border.

The bird weighed in at just under 400g and was an early member of the group that gave rise to modern-day chickens, ducks and other poultry.

At the time, the region was covered by a shallow sea, and conditions were similar to modern tropical beaches. With its long, slender legs, the bird may have been a shore dweller.

""Birds are such a conspicuous and important group of living animals, being able to say something new about how modern birds actually arose is really a significant thing for palaeontologists and evolutionary biologists,"" said Dr Field.

""The wonderchicken is going to rank as a truly important fossil for helping clarify the factors that actually gave rise to modern birds.""

The research is published in the journal Nature.

"Greenland shed an extraordinary 600 billion tonnes of ice by the end of summer last year.

This melt-driven loss would have raised global sea levels by 2.2mm, say scientists who've just published an analysis of satellite gravity measurements taken over the Arctic.

Of course, when winter set in, some of that mass would have been recovered as it snowed across the ice sheet.

The data comes from the joint US-German space mission known as Grace-FO.

It's actually a pair of satellites that circle the globe, sensing the ""lumps and bumps"" in Earth's gravity field that correspond to variations in mass.

Key signals being detected are changes in the amount of water stored on land surfaces and the withering state of the planet's great ice fields.

FO stands for ""follow on"" because the project is a successor to a mission that flew from 2002 to 2017.

The analysis appearing in the journal Geophysical Research Letters (GRL) on Wednesday is essentially a first attempt to match up the new observational tool with the old.

It's a task that was made more challenging than it should have been, concede scientists.

In part that was because there was a seven-month gap in operations (Grace-FO wasn't launched until 2018), but also because the new mission, once in orbit, was found to be carrying an underperforming accelerometer instrument.

The team has had to find a work-around for this disappointment.

""But the exciting news is we are working and we are working well. And that's important because Grace gives us a really unique way of looking at the ice sheets and their glaciers,"" Prof Isabella Velicogna, from the University of California at Irvine and the US space agency's (Nasa) Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told BBC News.

Other types of satellite measure the ice sheets by capturing changes in velocity or shape. Grace, on the other hand, literally weighs the ice from orbit. It's therefore an independent check on those other satellites' methods.

The big take-home from the GRL paper is that the new gravity mission is capturing all major trends.

The Greenland melt of last summer would have been hard to miss. It was extreme. On a par with the very warm summer of 2012.

In the coastal town of Ilulissat, not far from where the mighty Jakobshavn Glacier enters the ocean, temperatures reached into the high 20s Celsius.

And even in the ice sheet's interior, at its highest point, temperatures got to about zero.

""It's significant that we're now seeing melt and mass loss extending to Greenland's northern glaciers. All of Greenland contributed to the big summer melt of last year,"" said Prof Velicogna.

Across the entire period of the two missions - 2002 to 2019 - Greenland has lost some 4,550 billion tonnes of ice, an average of 268 billion tonnes annually, which puts the scale of last summer into further context.

In Antarctica, for the full Grace period, the ice sheet is seen to be losing just over 100 billion tonnes every year. The match-up between the old and new gravity measurements is not quite as consistent as in Greenland, but this should improve with time, commented Prof Andrew Shepherd from Leeds University, UK.

""This is the first effort to cross-calibrate the missions which is really welcome because the Grace gravity data is important for our science. That's a massive positive. No-one expects a first paper, the first data from a mission, to be perfect; the processing of the data can only get better,"" he told BBC News.

"One of the UK’s most popular wildlife tourism destinations is getting a back-to-nature makeover.

Conservationists have teamed up to triple the size of a nature sanctuary on Purbeck Heath by adding private land to three existing reserves.

It will create the largest lowland heathland in England and it’ll allow species to shift round the landscape as the climate changes.

The area is currently among the finest in the UK for wildlife diversity.

However, proponents say the new plan for the site in Dorset will allow smarter management.

The RSPB’s Peter Robertson told BBC News: “In recent years we’ve been trying to protect individual species on a micro-level on small fragmented sites.

“Sometimes we’ve even employed volunteers to reshape the earth with trowels to help a single type of wasp.

“Now the fences are coming down, we’ll be able to allow grazing animals to roam around and do the job of disturbing the ground and creating different habitats for us.”

Glimpses of wildlife
The Purbeck area – stretching from Poole to Wareham in the south-west of England – already attracts more than 2.5 million visitors a year, and many come to catch a glimpse of red squirrels or seabirds.

The new, expanded National Nature Reserve is a mosaic of lowland wet and dry heath, valley mires, acid grassland and woodland, along with coastal sand dunes, lakes and saltmarsh. It’s the size of Blackpool.

It nurtures star attractions like rare sand lizards; Dartford warblers, silver-studded blue butterflies; nightjars; smooth snakes; and woodlarks.

At the heart of the reserve are two large tracts of mostly forested ground owned by Forestry England and the Rempstone Estate. They’ve both agreed to co-operate with the nature plan.

Removing forests
Much of the forest will be removed and the land will be restored to wet heath, which is highly effective at trapping carbon in the soil.

Other partners are Natural England; Forestry England; Dorset Wildlife Trust and Amphibian and Reptile Conservation and the National Trust.

Angela Cott, the National Trust’s manager on Brownsea island in Poole Harbour, told BBC News the new reserve is the latest initiative in a long drive to return local farmland to nature.

“Brownsea Island was lowland heath since prehistoric times, but the Victorians worked hard to convert it into farmland and forestry,” she said. “We’re in it for managing nature now. It’s being transformed.”

Doug Ryder, whose family has owned land on Purbeck for hundreds of years, told BBC News: “The estate sees the benefit of a combined management approach to enhance the environment, while balancing that with the continued need to operate a viable, rural estate for all those who derive their livelihood from it.

""Who benefits from the nature reserve? We all do... but the biggest winner has to be the environment itself.""

"From Greta Thunberg to Donald Trump and airlines to oil companies, everyone is suddenly going crazy for trees.

The UK government has pledged to plant millions a year while other countries have schemes running into billions.

But are these grand ambitions achievable? How much carbon dioxide do trees really pull in from the atmosphere? And what happens to a forest, planted amid a fanfare, over the following decades?

How many will the UK plant?
Last year's UK general election became a contest to look green.

The Conservatives' pledge of planting 30 million trees a year, confirmed in the Budget this week, is a big step up on current rates. Critics wonder whether it's possible given that earlier targets were far easier and weren't met.

If the new planting rate is achieved, it would lead to something like 17% of the UK becoming forested, as opposed to 13% now.

Tree planting is a popular idea because forests are not only beautiful but also useful: they support wildlife, help with holding back floodwater and provide timber.

And trees absorb carbon dioxide - the main gas heating the planet - so planting more of them is seen by many as a climate change solution.

At the moment, the UK's forests pull in about 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year but the hope is to more than double that.

How many trees can you plant?
What if everybody in the world planted a tree?
Tree planting: Where can I do it and which type is best?
It would involve potentially sensitive decisions about where to turn fields into forests: for example, should trees be planted where crops are grown or where cattle or sheep are grazed?

And because it can take decades to get a financial return from trees, many farmers and landowners are waiting for the government to announce new incentives.

Can you plant that many?
Yes, with the right people.

I watched a team of people in their 20s working on a project for the Forestry Commission, in Norfolk, and their speed was phenomenal. When they got going, I timed each of them planting a tree roughly every four seconds.

During the course of a day, they could plant between 2,000 and 4,000 trees, piercing the soil with a shovel, stooping down to bury the roots of a tiny Douglas Fir, pressing the sapling in with a boot, and then pacing out the gap to the next one.

There are machines that can do the job - and even drones - but people power is the tried and tested method. And good money can be earned - about 7p for every tree.

For years, it's been popular among students in Canada as a summer job. But inspiring the same enthusiasm among British people is a different story.

Liz Boivin, whose company Tomorrow's Forests employs the team I visited, finds it is Canadians, Australians and eastern Europeans who most regularly sign up for a season's work.

She doubts whether there are enough trained staff in Britain to support the government's plans for a huge increase in planting.

""You need to have the workforce to hit those numbers, which at the moment you don't have,"" she says.

What problems could there be?
Trees grow very slowly so it's not enough just to plant them and then walk away.

In their early years, saplings are extremely vulnerable to a long list of threats: droughts, storms, pests and diseases. So it's possible that around a quarter of a newly-planted forest will die young.

Only when the survivors make it to an age of 20-30 years do they draw in significant amounts of carbon dioxide. By this stage, the forest will only thrive if some trees are removed or ""thinned"" to allow more room for others to develop.

If the timber from the cleared trees is then used in buildings, the carbon will remain locked up for as long as the structure stands. But if the trees are left unattended and end up dying and rotting, all the carbon that had been stored will then be released.

So the key is a plan for careful management, according to Stuart Goodall, who runs Confor, a forest industries association. He's worried that the mania for trees may turn out to be a passing fashion, with investors excited by the planting but not by the long years that follow.

""We don't want to be rushed by others who have taken a sudden interest and may run away in 5-10 years' time,"" he says.

For a big increase in tree planting, Mr Goodall says there will need to be far greater supply of saplings but British nurseries are wary of scaling up until they're sure the government is serious.

Can trees stop climate change?
The answer is more complicated than you might think.

Trees use carbon dioxide as part of the process of photosynthesis - with the carbon ending up in the branches, trunk and roots. But at the same time they rely on respiration, which releases some carbon dioxide.

That's why, over the years, people have described trees as ""breathing"" - inhaling and exhaling a flow of gases. And it turns out that understanding exactly how that flow works is extremely hard.

Prof Rob MacKenzie, of the University of Birmingham, is honest about the lack of knowledge. ""There are lots of things we don't know about the precise movement of carbon.""
We're in a hi-tech outdoor laboratory that he runs in a forest in Staffordshire.

Instruments are mounted on tree trunks and on the ground to measure every aspect of how the trees are functioning. Research so far has shown that every square metre draws in about 1,700g of CO2 every year - while also releasing up to 1,200g.

And as a forest gets older, those flows are likely to become more balanced. Prof MacKenzie says it would be a ""disaster"" if governments and companies rely on forests to ""clear up the mess"" of carbon pollution.

And he paints a grim picture of what could go wrong. ""We plant lot of trees, we think we've done the job, we forget about them, and what we're left with is a really desolate dying diseased landscape that no one cares about.""

So what are the solutions?
Partly, they involve choosing the right trees and partly it's about making sure that local people benefit.

In the sprawling forest of Thetford, in Norfolk, much of it planted in a rush after the First World War, Eleanor Tew has researched the best options.

Back in the 1960s and 1970s, a government-encouraged rash of planting ended up with regimented rows of the same species of conifers - which meant they were susceptible to the same pests and diseases.

For Eleanor, it's important to make sure that future forests are more resilient.

""It's a bit like making sure you don't put all your eggs in one basket,"" she says. ""It may seem that the obvious thing is to plant one species that's really good for timber or another species that's good for carbon but if they don't cope with a disease, then the whole forest fails.""

And for Nathalie Seddon, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford, it's vital that forestry schemes, particularly in developing countries, aren't imposed on the people there, but instead involve them.

She points to a project in the Humbo region of Ethiopia where farmers were encouraged to regenerate woodland by being given legal rights over the trees and also by getting training in forest management.

By contrast, a forestry scheme in northwest China successfully protected people living there from dust storms - a positive development - but the growth of the trees then led to water shortages in villages downstream.

She says: ""There is an idea that you can just buy land and plant trees but that's too simplistic - there is a risk of doing more harm than good.""
",Climate change: Will planting millions of trees really save the planet?
"The rich are primarily to blame for the global climate crisis, a study by the University of Leeds of 86 countries claims.

The wealthiest tenth of people consume about 20 times more energy overall than the bottom ten, wherever they live.

The gulf is greatest in transport, where the top tenth gobble 187 times more fuel than the poorest tenth, the research says.

That’s because people on the lowest incomes can rarely afford to drive.

The researchers found that the richer people became, the more energy they typically use. And it was replicated across all countries.

And they warn that, unless there's a significant policy change, household energy consumption could double from 2011 levels by 2050. That's even if energy efficiency improves.

Transport gulf

The researchers combined European Union and World Bank data to calculate how different income groups spend their money. They say it’s the first study of its kind.

It found that in transport the richest tenth of consumers use more than half the energy. This reflects previous research showing that 15% of UK travellers take 70% of all flights.

The ultra-rich fly by far furthest, while 57% of the UK population does not fly abroad at all.

The study, published in Nature Energy, showed that energy for cooking and heating is more equitably consumed.

But even then, the top 10% of consumers used roughly one third of the total, presumably reflecting the size of their homes.

Solutions?

Co-author Professor Julia Steinberger, leader of the project at Leeds, asked: “How can we change the vastly unequal distribution of energy to provide a decent life for everyone while protecting the climate and ecosystems?”

The authors say governments could reduce transport demand through better public transport, higher taxes on bigger vehicles and frequent flyer levies for people who take most holidays.

They say another alternative is to electrify vehicles more quickly, although previous studies suggest even then demand for driving must be reduced in order to reduce the strain on resource use and electricity production and distribution.

Rich Brits

The research also examined the relative energy consumption of one nation against another.

It shows that a fifth of UK citizens are in the top 5% of global energy consumers, along with 40% of German citizens, and Luxembourg’s entire population.

Only 2% of Chinese people are in the top global 5% of users, and just 0.02% of people in India.

Even the poorest fifth of Britons consumes over five times as much energy per person as the bottom billion in India.

The study is likely to ignite future UN climate negotiations, where the issue of equity is always bitterly contentious.

In the USA, libertarian politicians have typically portrayed climate change as a harbinger of global socialism.

Normal lives?

But Professor Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre in Manchester, who was not involved in the study, told BBC News: “This study tells relatively wealthy people like us what we don’t want to hear.

“The climate issue is framed by us high emitters – the politicians, business people, journalists, academics. When we say there’s no appetite for higher taxes on flying, we mean WE don’t want to fly less

“The same is true about our cars and the size our homes. We have convinced ourselves that our lives are normal, yet the numbers tell a very different story,” he said.

The study says transport energy alone could increase 31% by 2050. “If transport continues to rely on fossil fuels, this increase would be disastrous for the climate,” the report says.

It suggests different remedies for different types of energy use. So, flying and driving big cars could face higher taxes, while energy from homes could be reduced by a housing retrofit.

The authors note that the recent Budget declined to increase fuel duty and promised 4,000 miles of new roads. It did not mention home insulation.

The Treasury was contacted to discuss the taxation issues raised in the research, but declined to comment.

"British photographer Andrew Newey has documented the lives of the Changpa nomads in Kashmir, examining the threats to their Pashmina wool production.

Andrew Newey spent two weeks with the Changpa nomads in freezing conditions in Ladakh, in Indian-administered Kashmir.

To accompany his photo series, Newey also learned about the history of Pashmina wool production, and the threats to the nomadic shepherds' way of life and traditions.

He explains in his own words: ""At an altitude of more than 14,000ft, where winter temperatures can fall to -40 degrees Celsius, it is hard to believe anyone or anything can survive in this vast ice desert that is the Changthang Plateau.

""Situated between the Himalayan and Karakorum mountain ranges, it is the highest permanently inhabited plateau in the world, and home to an extremely hardy and rare breed of goat - the Changra, or Pashmina goat.

""The high altitude, freezing temperatures and harsh bitter winds in this unforgiving mountainous region are essential to stimulate the growth of the goats' super-soft undercoat.

""The fibres measure a mere eight to 10 microns in width, making it around 10 times finer than human hair and eight times warmer than sheep wool.

""This luxurious fibre is known the world over as Pashmina, the softest and most expensive type of Cashmere wool in the world.

""For centuries the Changpa nomads, who themselves are as hardy as their animals, have roamed 'the roof of the world', moving their herds of yak, sheep and goats along traditional migratory routes in this high altitude desert every few months, in search of fresh grazing pastures.

""This ancient way of life is now very much under threat from climate change, fake Pashmina imports from China, the need for better education and the desire simply for an easier and more comfortable life.

""The nomads and scientists alike are adamant that climate change is the biggest threat to Pashmina production in the region.

""The Changthang plateau does not usually get much snowfall, and if it does, it begins in January or February.

""However, for the last few years it has been increasingly heavy, starting as early as December, even November.

""As a result, food supplements have to be brought in to prevent the animals dying from starvation. Also, the winters have been getting warmer, which has reduced the quality and quantity of the valuable Pashmina wool.

""Cashmere is expensive, and rightly so. The Changpa carefully comb the hair during the spring moulting season to harvest the downy undercoat, and then the good fibre is laboriously separated from the bad by hand.

""Once the fibres are manually sorted, cleaned and hand-spun, the weaving process can begin, which is equally demanding and painstaking.

""It takes several months to a year for highly skilled artisans to work their magic on wooden looms and weave a masterpiece which will be exported around the world, selling for between £150 ($200) and £1,500 ($2,000) by luxury retailers.

""Another issue of concern is the increasing number of snow leopards in the region, putting their animals at increasing risk of attack. This is a result of the successful conservation efforts over the last decade.

""The threat to Pashmina goat-rearing would mean the end of the livelihoods of about 300,000 people in the Jammu and Kashmir state who, directly or indirectly, depend on Pashmina.

""It would also mean an end to the unique culture of the Changpas; most of them are followers of Tibetan Buddhism, and have an elaborate set of customs centred around their livestock.""

"In 2017, New Zealand granted legal personhood to the Whanganui River. Since then, other nations have followed suit in an effort to protect the environment.

Flowing through the heart of New Zealand’s North Island, the Whanganui River is one of the country’s most important natural resources. The river begins its 290km journey on the snowy north-western side of the Mount Tongariro active volcano, winding between green hills and mountains until it meets the Tasman Sea. Revered for centuries by the Whanganui tribes – who take their name, spirit and strength from the river they live near – it became the first river in the world to be recognised as a legal person in 2017, bringing closure to one of New Zealand’s longest-running court cases.

The Maori, the indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand, had been fighting for more than 160 years to get legal protection for the river. The Whanganui tribes have nurtured a deep connection with the waterway for at least 880 years – more than 700 years before European settlers arrived. They have relied on it for much of their food, travelled it by canoe and built villages on its banks.

In Maori culture, tupuna, or “ancestors”, live on in the natural world and it is the community’s duty to protect both the landscape they inherited and those who came before them. Humans and water are especially believed to be intertwined – a traditional saying is, “I am the river, the river is me”. Having the river recognised as a legal person means harming it is the same as harming the tribe. If there is any kind of abuse or threat to its waters, such as pollution or unauthorised activities, the river can sue. It also means it can own property, enter contracts and be sued itself.

Environmental personhood has been studied as a way of protecting nature since at least the 1970s. In his book Should Trees Have Standing?, American law professor Christopher D Stone argued that environmental interests should be recognised apart from human ones. His work influenced Maori academics James Morris and Jacinta Ruru, who wrote Giving Voice to Rivers, making a case for why waterways in New Zealand should be seen as legal people.

The Whanganui River is not the only instance of a natural resource being granted legal personhood in New Zealand. In 2014, the Te Urewera park, the ancestral home of the Tuhoe people, became the first natural feature in the country to be recognised as a legal person. In 2018, Mount Taranaki – a 120,000 year-old stratovolcano sacred to the Maori – was awarded the same status. But the Whanganui River has been perhaps the most influential: following the decision in 2017, the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India and all rivers in Bangladesh also received legal rights – although, in India, the decision was later revoked.
