# Following: https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy
# First setup:

(install gcloud)
(make project XYZ on the https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/)
gcloud auth login
gcloud projects list # see the PROJECT-ID there
gcloud config set project PROJECT-ID


# Building
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/helloworld
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/helloworld --platform managed --memory 512M

# PS, we can add: --memory 1Gi --timeout=1m20s (by default 256M memory and 5minutes timeout) (see https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/memory-limits)
( allow unauthenticated invocations: respond y )
( will give you url to the project:  SOMEURL.run.app )

# Some details about the service settings (for example https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/about-concurrency)
gcloud run services list # get services such as "text2analysis"
gcloud run services describe SERVICE
gcloud run services update SERVICE --concurrency CONCURRENCY # might not be a good idea ...


# Testing locally
sudo gcloud auth configure-docker
PORT=8080 && sudo docker run -p 9090:${PORT} -e PORT=${PORT} gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/IMAGE
# Then manage docker images with
docker container ls -a
docker system prune


# Inspect projects and their logs at:
https://console.cloud.google.com/run?project=PROJECT_ID


# Notes:
- Cloud Run works nicely when we only need CPU (probably because then it can be spinned down easily and causes no extra costs?)
  (Then the pricing model of cost/per request makes sense)

- GPU equipped version of this is using "Anthos" option (See Anthos - https://cloud.google.com/run/choosing-a-platform),
  which means creating a cluster where I can choose whatever setup for the server
  (this includes the gpu heavy ones). However it's paid per minute. (I think)
  Additionally, you seem to need to have a domain - or use a free redirection one like nip.io (see https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/gke/default-domain)
  ... all of it seems to be much bigger pain to setup, manage, control if it's running etc. (CPU version seems easy when compared...)
